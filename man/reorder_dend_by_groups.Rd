\title{Reorder a dendrogram to keep specified groups of tips adjacent}
\usage{
reorder_dend_by_groups(dend, groups_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{An object of class \code{dendrogram}.}

\item{groups_list}{A list of character vectors. Each vector contains the tip
labels that should be kept adjacent. e.g., list(g1=c("a","b"),
g2=c("c","d")).}
}
\value{
A reordered \code{dendrogram} object.
}
\description{
This function reorders the tips (leaves) of a dendrogram so that elements
belonging to predefined groups appear together. This is useful in
hierarchical clustering visualization where it is desired to have clusters or
groups to appear contiguously.
}
\examples{
set.seed(42)

mat <- matrix(rnorm(12*3), nrow = 12)
rownames(mat) <- paste0("T", 1:12)

# Hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(dist(mat))
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

# Plot
plot(dend, main = "Original dendrogram")


# Groups that align with the dendrogram structure
#'
groups_preserved <- list(
  GroupA = c("T1", "T2", "T3"),
  GroupB = c("T4", "T5", "T6"),
  GroupC = c("T7", "T8")
)

dend_preserved <- reorder_dend_by_groups(dend, groups_preserved)

plot(dend_preserved, main = "Groups preserved (no warning)")

# Define groups that do NOT align with dendrogram
# These tips are far apart in the dendrogram
groups_split <- list(
  GroupX = c("T1", "T5", "T9"),
  GroupY = c("T2", "T6", "T10")
)

dend_split <- reorder_dend_by_groups(dend, groups_split)

# Plot
plot(dend_split, main = "Groups split (warning expected)")
